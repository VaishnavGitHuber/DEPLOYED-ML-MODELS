# DEPLOYED-ML-MODELS
## DEPLOYED MODELS USING FLASK
This repository contain all the ML models which are deployed with all the codes and dataset 
1. IRIS CLASSIFICATION MODEL
* This is classification model using only petal width for the predicted.accuracy of the model is above 96%+ and i have used SVC(Support vector michine) algorithm for the prediction
* Not added the environment file due to large space limitataion. if you want to deploy  the model please create a enviroment
* commands:
*           python -m venv myvenv
*           pip install flask
*           pip install scikit-learn
